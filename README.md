# latex-knitr

latex-knitr is an example project to allow you to get started using R's knitr package with latex on MS Windows.
Look at the PDF file example-doc.pdf in the doc directory. This is the expected output when you compile this
latex/knitr code. It is really an extension to this Readme and has important information about compilation.
