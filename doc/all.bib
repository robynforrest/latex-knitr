% all.bib
% Originally Andy's abbrev4.bib file. Some modifications for clarity and organization.
%    journal   = {DFO Can. Sci. Advis. Sec. Res. Doc.}
%  rather than usual
%    journal   = {DFO Can.~Sci.~Advis.~Sec.~Res.~Doc.}
%  because it splits the line at DFO and won't split elsewhere. Can't really
%  tell if double spaces after. (Maybe recent latex realises it's not
%  separating sentences).
% Also add a period at the end of non-abbreviated journal names (unusual
%  ones like
%  journal      = {Fisheries and Marine Service, Nanaimo, BC, Data Record.},
%    that aren't abbreviated.
% I have done CSAS SAR's and Res Doc's just as usual articles, rather than
%  create a new category. CSAS may insist that the : should be a . before the
%  page numbers. Just do manually in .bbl file.
% Also, manually do the ordering correctly for multiple-author references.
%
% Any websites have to be clickable in the .pdf. This gets done automatically
%  but wouldn't work if they had _ in them, which is \_ in latex. May need
%  href package for that. So not giving links for Res Docs. \& does work
%  automatically though, I think \_ gets coded differently.
